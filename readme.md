Katana is a PHP static site & blog generator with markdown support built using Laravel's [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/blade).
It converts your `.blade.php` files into static HTML files and handle pretty links out of the box.

**Blade** is the simple, yet powerful templating engine provided with Laravel.
Unlike other popular PHP templating engines, Blade does not restrict you from using plain PHP code in your views.
